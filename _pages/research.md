I love working on statistical problems that have direct links to applied problems. In my dissertation work, I work on methods in Small Area Estimation that are relied upon to allocate billions of dollars for the largest government programs in the US. 

Some of my interests include:

* Bayesian Methods
* Small Area Estimation
* Areal/Spatial Data Modeling
* Using Machine Learning Techniques to Improve Statistical Models 

I am co-advised by [Zehang Li](https://zehangli.com) and [Paul Parker](https://www.paparkerstat.com).

**Updates:**

* My first dissertation project was published in the The Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series A (JRSS-A)!
  + *Spatially Selected and Dependent Random Effects for Small Area Estimation with Application to Rent Burden*
  + [Access the publication here](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jrsssa/qnaf063/8167071?searchresult=1).
* Presented the paper at JSM 2024 in Portland [(link to slides)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14CTDxXFGC63Skf-RMU7ByqgaTIAOYqeD/view?usp=sharing).
* This paper won the Wray Jackson Smith Award from the Government Statistics Section of the ASA
