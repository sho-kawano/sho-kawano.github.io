### Personal

I'm always be changing but people often describe me as energetic, funny, and open. I love traveling, cooking, sports, gardening, and spending time with my partner Laura.  I try to value relationships & experiences more than stuff. I want to be remembered as someone with a big heart.

Insight Meditation practice has and continues to change my life for the better.

#### My Story

**I was born in Tokyo, Japan.**  My mom was born here while my grandpa was at CalTech [^1], which enables me to be a US citizen[^2]. Balancing my Japanese roots with my American upbringing was challenging but rewarding.

**Grew up in Hawaii** which is a gentle, beautiful place. Blessed to have grown up there.

**Moved to Northern California in 2008.** I went to a hippy-arts type of High School in Sacramento. I played sports & loved doing theatre. I also love Sac!

**Adventures in the East Bay.** At UC Berkeley, I was mostly interested in clean energy (statistics was a secondary interest).  After college, I worked for a major solar energy developer.

**Big Changes.** In 2019, let go from what I thought was my dream job, went on an amazing trip to SE Asia, began dating Laura, and started to seriously meditate. These things have been the best things that have ever happened to me.

**Back in Sacramento.** Moved back right before Covid. Worked at the State Government which made me believe in the importance of people with technical skills in civil service.

**Grad School Phase 1:**  Started my PhD program splitting my time between Sacramento & Santa Cruz.

**Now:** Mostly in Sacramento after finishing my courses. Just got married & reflecting more about what the future together could look like.
