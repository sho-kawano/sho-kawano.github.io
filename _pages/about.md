People often describe me as energetic, funny, and open. I love traveling, cooking, cafe-ing, sports, exploring cities, and spending time with my partner Laura. I try to value relationships & experiences more than stuff. I want to be remembered as someone with a big heart.

Insight Meditation practice has and continues to change my life for the better.
