### <a name="research"></a>  Research


I am broadly interested in developing statistical tools for applications relevant to public policy and public health.
More specifically I'm interested in:

* Official Statistics
* Small Area Estimation
* Disease Mapping
* Areal Data Modeling
* Markov Random Field Models
* Bayesian Methods

I am co-advised by [Zehang Li](https://zehangli.com) and [Paul Parker](https://www.paparkerstat.com).

**Update:**

* Recently completed a project that is the first chapter of my dissertation.
  + [Access the ArXiv preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12463).
* Excited to be presenting this paper at [JSM in Portland](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2024/).
  + August 4th, 2024 at 4:00pm-5:50pm.
  + Session Name: *Innovative Modeling Approaches for Small Area Estimation in the Presence of Complex Dependence Structures*

#### Stat 5 Curriculum Re-Development

I'm currently working with [Professor Marcela Alfaro Córdoba](https://malfaro.netlify.app/) on redeveloping the curriculum for one of the intro-statistics class at UC Santa Cruz (Stat 5).  I'm excited about this work, especially since Stat 5 is a class over 1200 students take every year!

#### Classes Taught At UCSC

Teaching is arguably the most impactful part of my graduate training. I have especially enjoyed teaching introductory statistics.

The following are the classes I have served as a teaching assistant for.
If you're a TA and would like access to any of my slides or materials, please contact me.
