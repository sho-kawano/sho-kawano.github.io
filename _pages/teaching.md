<sub>My first class I taught at UCSC!</sub>

**Intro Stats Curriculum Re-Development**

I worked with [Professor Marcela Alfaro Córdoba](https://malfaro2.github.io) on redeveloping the curriculum for one of the intro-statistics class at UC Santa Cruz (Stat 5).  I'm proud of this work, especially since Stat 5 is a class over 1200 students take every year. 

**Classes Taught at UCSC**

Teaching is arguably the most impactful part of my graduate training. I have especially enjoyed teaching introductory statistics.

The following are the classes I have served as a teaching assistant for.
