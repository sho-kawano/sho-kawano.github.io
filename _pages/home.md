Currently, I am a Ph.D Candidate at the Statistics Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I like to meditate, travel, cook, cafe, laugh, and spend time with my wife Laura. 

This site is a blend of professional / personal content where I discuss a bunch of different things I'm interested in including statistics, data science, travel, urban design, etc.
