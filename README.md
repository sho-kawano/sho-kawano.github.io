# Academic Derrick — Minimal Theme for Jekyll


Derrick is a clean minimal and fast theme for a personal blog. See the original repo for full details.

I made some major edits to the Derrick blogging theme to make it more suitable for an academic page.
My goal was to create an academic page that has a more photographer-blog like feel and less sterile. 

Changes made to original Derrick Theme:
* Wider texts for the main page.  Moved the blogroll/posts away from the main page to its own section.
* Modified textsize for pages and posts
* Added caption to the main photo for pages and posts
* Edited the posts to make the main content rolls up together with the header
* Edited the formatting of the posts (smaller font, mostly)


Note: Tags for blog posts does not work on Github pages and it seems to be a pain to implement. [You can follow guides like this but I didn't bother](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/#:~:text=If%20you%20want%20to%20add,Ruby%20plugins%20for%20Jekyll%20site)
