  bio: |+
    <br />
    I'm currently a PhD Student in Statistics at UC Santa Cruz.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am broadly interested in developing statistical tools for applications relevant to public policy.
    I previously worked in clean energy with brief stints in air pollution research and the CA State Government (DHCS).
    <br />
    I hope to use my skills to somehow benefit society.
    <br />
    <br />
    This site is a blend of professional/personal content.
    <br />
    My career is only a part of who I am.
