One of the joys/horrors of TA-ing is that you always encounter things that stumps you as well as your students. Here is a very basic looking problem that stumped me from *Introduction to Probability by Joe Blitzstein and Jessica Hwang* (Ch2 Q37):

<br />

> Two different dieseases cause a certain weird symptom: anyone who has either or both of these dieseases will experience the symptom.  Let \\(D_1 \\) be the event of having the first disease, \\(D_2 \\) be the event of having the second, and \\(W \\) be the event of having the weird symptom. Suppose \\(D_1 \\) and \\(D_2 \\) are independent with \\(P(D_j) = p_j \\) and that a person with neither disease will have the weird symptom with probability \\(w_0 \\). Let \\(q_j =1-p_j \\).


**NOTE**: Feel free to jump to (d) since this is long.


### (a) Find \\(P(W)\\)

We can use the Law of Total Probability (LOTP).

So let \\(D_1 \cup D_2 \\) be the event that you have at least one disease.  
Let \\(D_1^c \cap D_2^c \\) be the probability that you have neither.

Then  

\\[ P(W) = P(W \mid D_1 \cup D_2) P(D_1 \cup D_2) + P(W \mid D_1^c \cap D_2^c) P(D_1^c \cap D_2^c) \\]


So using the laws of probability youâ€™ve learned:
 \\(P(D_1 \cup D_2) = p_1  + p_2 - p_1p_2 \\)  And \\(P(D_1^c \cap D_2^c)=(1-p_1 )(1-p_2) = q_1q_2\\).

Anyone who has at least one of the diseases *will* have weird symptoms with probability=1.
Thus \\(P(W \mid D_1 \cup D_2) =1\\).   
We are given that probability that you have a weird disease without having the disease is \\(w_0\\).
Thus we have \\(P(W) = 1 ( p_1  + p_2 - p_1p_2) + w_0 q_1 q_2\\).  


### (b)
#### Find \\(P(D_i \mid W)\\)

We need to find the prob. that you have disease \\(i \\) given weird symptoms
Note that using the formula for conditional probability:
 \\[ P(Di \mid W) = \frac{P(D_i \cap W)} {P(W)} = \frac{P( W \mid Di) P(Di)}  {P(W)}   \\]

We already know \\(P( W \mid Di)= 1\\).  

Using result from (a), for \\(i=1,2 \\) we have:

 \\[ P(Di \mid W) = \frac{P(D_i)}  {P(W)} = \frac{p_i} {( p_1  + p_2 - p_1p_2) +w_0 q_1q_2}  . \\]


#### Find \\(P(D_1 \cap D_2 \mid W)\\)
We need to find the prob. that you have both diseases given weird symptoms
We can solve things in a similar fashion:
\\[ P(D_1 \cap D_2 \mid W) =\frac{P( W \mid D_1 \cap D_2) P(D_1 \cap D_2)}  {P(W)}   = \frac {P(D_1 D_2)} {P(W)} = \frac{ p_1 p_2 }{( p_1  + p_2 - p_1p_2) +w_0 q_1q_2}.\\]


###  (c)  Are \\(D_1, D_2 \\) conditionally independent on \\(W \\)?

 Note that for conditional independence to be possible we must have
 \\(P(D_1 \cap D_2\mid W) = P(D_1\mid W)  P(D_2\mid W). \\)  
But we have

\\[P(D_1\mid W)  P(D_2\mid W)  = \frac{p_1}{P(W)}    \frac{p_2}{P(W)}. \\]    

This is not generally equal to

\\[ P(D_1 \cap D_2 \mid W) = \frac{p_1 p_2}{P(W)}.  \\]

unless \\(w_0=1 \\)(see part (d)).  

Thus by contradiction, these events are not conditionally independent.  

### (d) What if \\(w_0=0\\)?  

If \\(w_0=0\\), we have \\[ P(D_1 \cap D_2 \mid W) = \frac{p_1 p_2}{p_1 + p_2 - p_1p_2}.\\]


Which is still NOT equal to \\[P(D_1\mid W)  P(D_2\mid W) =  \frac{p_1} {p_1  + p_2 - p_1p_2} \times \frac{p_2} {p_1  + p_2 - p_1p_2}.\\]
Thus they are not conditionally independent.  

#### Explanation: Two independent events may NOT be conditionally independent

This is a gnarly example of the counter-intuitive nature of probability.
This is related to the [Berkson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox)!


Note that one way to look at independence of two events \\( A,  B\\) is to think about things this way:

> ...  knowing the outcome of event B has no impact on the likelihood of A happening.

So if two events are dependent then...

> ...  knowing the outcome of event B changes the likelihood of A happening.


In this case, we are given that someone has weird symptoms: \\(W \\).
Then two events we are considering are:  \\(D_1 \mid  W \\)and \\(D_2 \mid  W\\).
Since we are given \\(W \\), they must have \\(D_1 \\)and \\(D_2 \\)since \\(w_0=0\\).

Suppose you know that they don't have \\(D_1\\).  Then they MUST have \\(D_2 \\) since they have weird symptoms.
Hence knowing \\(D_1 \mid W \\) impacts the likelihood of \\(D_2 \mid W\\).

The only way \\(D_1 \mid  W \\) and \\(D_2 \mid  W \\) are independent is if \\(w_0=1\\).
In that case \\(w_0 q_1q_2 = 1-p_1 -p_2 +p_1 p_2 \\) and
 \\(P(W) = (p_1  + p_2 - p_1p_2)  + (1-p_1 -p_2 +p_1 p_2) =1 \\).
Then knowing \\(W \\)won't change anything since everyone has weird symptoms.
